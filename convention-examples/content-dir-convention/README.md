This follows the [Nextra 4 Docs Theme "Get Started" docs](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/start) using [Content Directory convention](https://nextra.site/docs/file-conventions/content-directory).

Questions:

- As I understand it, we should be able to target any pages in the `/content` directory (this is the "quickest" method to convert from v3 --> v4, according to docs - renaming `/pages` to `/content`), but adding the top-nav-1/2 folders as subfolders breaks
- side-nav-1/2 not working with meta files yet
